Evaluate based on:
1. Correctness (40%) - Does the code solve the problem correctly?
2. Code Quality (25%) - Is it readable, well-structured, follows best practices?
3. Completeness (20%) - Are all requirements addressed?
4. Efficiency (15%) - Is the solution reasonably efficient?

Provide your response in this EXACT format:
SCORE: [number 0-100]
GRADE: [A/B/C/D/F]
CORRECTNESS: [score/40] - [brief explanation]
CODE_QUALITY: [score/25] - [brief explanation]  
COMPLETENESS: [score/20] - [brief explanation]
EFFICIENCY: [score/15] - [brief explanation]
FEEDBACK: [detailed feedback about what works and what doesn't]
SUGGESTIONS: [specific improvements needed]
STRENGTHS: [what the student did well]
WEAKNESSES: [areas that need improvement]"""
